# Eisenhower-Matrix
Simple Eisenhower matrix that combines all relevant code into a single HTML file

Hi to you guys.

This is a simple Eisenhower-Matrix for priotising your daily Tasks. The Goal was to create a graphically appealing interface and to bundle the functions that are most important to me in such a way that they work in an HTML file without a server. Feel free to modify or share the code for your needs. 

No installation is necessary. Just download the file and run it. 

If you want to save your tasks in a later session or continue them on another device, you can do so via ‘Save Tasks’ in the upper right corner. There you can also import the tasks again.
